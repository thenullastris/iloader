## Translating

iloader needs localization! If you speak another language and notice iloader does not support it or has mistakes, please consider contributing.

To update/edit an existing language, make a PR modifying `src/locales/<lang>.json`.

To add a new language, add your language to `src/i18next.ts`, and in `src/locales` copy `en.json` to a new file titled `<langcode>.json` and update the strings.

**i18next.ts:**

```ts
const languages = [
    ["en", "English"],
    ["es", "Español"],
    // Your language here...
] as const;
```

You can also add your name to the translators section of the README.

Thank you for translating!
